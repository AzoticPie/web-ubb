		<p>Carlos Rodríguez resigned as CEO of G2 on 23 September 2022, amidst controversy surrounding his acquaintanceship with Andrew Tate, known for his misogynistic commentary on social media.[4][5] He had previously been suspended from his position after a clip of him partying with Andrew and his brother Tristan Tate went viral.[6] Commentators later suspected this incident to be the reason for G2 being denied a franchise spot in the 2023 season of the Valorant Champions Tour.[7] Carlos Rodriguez was later suspended from Riot-sanctioned competition until 13 November 2022, having to follow a sensitivity and executive training to be allowed back to the LEC.[8]</p>
